# Example: Micro-Apps with Hyperlinks and Custom Elements

## TODO
- Angular-based Custom Elements are still too big: Ivy will solve this when released
- Same for VueJS-based WC

## Build and Start
This example constains several stand-alone SPAs. To build an run them together, use the following scripts:

```
npm run install:all
npm run build:all
npm start
```
